# Predicting Bulldozer Prices with LGBM: A Kaggle Dataset Analysis
This project utilizes the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers dataset to predict the sale price of bulldozers sold at auctions. The focus is on preprocessing and cleaning the dataset, exploring the data to uncover insights, and finally, training an LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) model to forecast bulldozer prices. Through meticulous data analysis and model tuning, this work aims to provide a robust predictive model, demonstrating the capabilities of LGBM in handling tabular data for regression tasks. 

All my code is contained in the main notebook "LGBM_model.ipynb". This file has thorough comments on all the steps followed from data cleaning to model training and evaluation that you can follow along. 

Files inside the "data" directory are data files, mostly from from Kaggle. From these, "Train.csv" was used for training and validating the dataset, while "Data Dcitionary.xlsx" was used for understanding the dataset, and "data_types.csv" was generated to understand the data types of different values (for cleaning the dataset, when deciding what to remove, what to impute etc.).
